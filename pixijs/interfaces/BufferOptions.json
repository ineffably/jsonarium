This is because\n * the underlying GPU buffer needs to know how it will be used. For example, if you are creating a buffer\n * to hold vertex data, you would use `BufferUsage.VERTEX`. This will tell the GPU that this buffer will be\n * used as a vertex buffer. This is important because it will affect how you can use the buffer.\n *\n * Buffers are updated by calling the {@link Buffer.update} method. This immediately updates the buffer on the GPU.\n * Be mindful of calling this more often than you need to. It is recommended to update buffers only when needed.\n *\n * In WebGPU, a GPU buffer cannot resized. This limitation is abstracted away, but know that resizing a buffer means\n * creating a brand new one and destroying the old, so it is best to limit this if possible.\n * @example\n *\n * const buffer = new Buffer({\n *     data: new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),\n *     usage: BufferUsage.VERTEX,\n * })",
