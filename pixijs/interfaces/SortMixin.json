Will get automatically set to true if a new child is added, or if a child's zIndex changes. / sortDirty?: boolean; /** If set to true, the container will sort its children by `zIndex` value when the next render is called, or manually if `sortChildren()` is called. This actually changes the order of elements in the array of children, so it will affect the rendering order. > [!NOTE] Also be aware of that this may not work nicely with the `addChildAt()` function, > as the `zIndex` sorting may cause the child to automatically sorted to another position. ```ts container.sortableChildren = true; ``` / sortableChildren?: boolean; } /** The SortMixin interface provides methods and properties for sorting children of a container based on their `zIndex` values. It allows for automatic sorting of children when their `zIndex` changes or when new children are added.
