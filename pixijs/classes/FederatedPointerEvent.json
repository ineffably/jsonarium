  "description": "A specialized event class for pointer interactions in PixiJS applications. Extends {@link FederatedMouseEvent} to provide advanced pointer-specific features while maintaining compatibility with the DOM PointerEvent interface. Key features: - Supports multi-touch interactions - Provides pressure sensitivity - Handles stylus input - Tracks pointer dimensions - Supports tilt detection ```ts // Basic pointer event handling sprite.on('pointerdown', (event: FederatedPointerEvent) => { // Access pointer information console.log('Pointer ID:', event.pointerId); console.log('Pointer Type:', event.pointerType); console.log('Is Primary:', event.isPrimary); // Get pressure and tilt data console.log('Pressure:', event.pressure); console.log('Tilt:', event.tiltX, event.tiltY); // Access contact geometry console.log('Size:', event.width, event.height); }); // Handle stylus-specific features sprite.on('pointermove', (event: FederatedPointerEvent) => { if (event.pointerType === 'pen') { // Handle stylus tilt const tiltAngle = Math.atan2(event.tiltY, event.tiltX); console.log('Tilt angle:', tiltAngle); // Use barrel button pressure console.log('Tangential pressure:', event.tangentialPressure); } }); ```",
